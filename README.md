# Hacking my way to an ideal fantasy football team

Last week, I was pressured into being the 12th member of a fantasy football league. Full disclosure, I know enough about football to enjoy a game without having to constantly look things up. I enjoy a good game of Madden, a few Panthers games, and casual watching, but I was never into football as much as my peers. I don't know enough about all the players out there to really make informed decisions about my picks for my fantasy team.

Being the data science major that I am, I decided to build my entire team algorithmically. Kaggle has a dataset on a ton of [NFL statistics](https://www.kaggle.com/kendallgillies/nflstatistics), and ESPN published its [scoring formats](http://games.espn.com/ffl/resources/help/content?name=scoring-formats) for how you win at fantasy. All that was left was ranking players based on these metrics so I could be prepared for the draft.

My draft has been scheduled for next week, so I ranked the top 12 players in each field since there's 12 people in my league. I didn't account for FLEX or anything else unique to fantasy.
